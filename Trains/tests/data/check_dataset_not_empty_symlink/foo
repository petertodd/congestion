>Hang on, aren't the tortoises of the animal kingdom... the tortoises?

Maybe the tortoise was our only natural predator for a couple million years.:-)

Og nearly collapsed. After about 70 kilometers, he couldn't run another step,
but he had to. If he stopped for rest, he knew sleep would take him. And
sleep meant death. He looked back across the grasslands he'd fled through.
Somewhere back there -- traveling slower than him, but with much more
endurance -- a patient, persistent predator marched onward, following Og's
scent.

Og knew.

The tortoises were coming.
